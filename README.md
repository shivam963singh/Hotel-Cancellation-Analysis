  <h1> Hotel Cancellation Data Analysis Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
Welcome to the Hotel Cancellation Data Analysis project! This repository showcases my expertise in data analytics, demonstrating skills in data cleaning, feature selection, insight generation,
and data visualization. The project analyzes a hotel booking dataset to uncover patterns and drivers of cancellations, delivering actionable insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a dynamic Power BI
dashboard. By combining Python-based analysis in Jupyter Notebook with advanced visualization in Power BI, this project highlights my ability to transform raw data into meaningful business solutions.




<h2>Objectives</h2>
Investigate key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations. Clean and preprocess raw data for accurate analysis. Perform feature selection to identify critical variables.
Derive actionable insights through statistical analysis and visualizations. Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to summarize findings effectively.

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

Python: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for exploratory data analysis and coding.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation for comprehensive insights.
Git & GitHub: Version control and project documentation.

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>

<li>1. Data Acquisition
 
  Dataset: Downloaded a CSV file containing hotel booking data (e.g., booking dates, customer details, cancellation status, etc.).</li>
<li>2. Data Loading and Cleaning
 
  Loaded the CSV dataset into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
  Performed basic cleaning:
  Handled missing values (e.g., filled or dropped nulls).
  Corrected data types (e.g., converted dates, encoded categorical variables).
  Removed duplicates and outliers to ensure data quality.</li>
<li>3. Feature Selection</li>
 
  Analyzed correlations and feature importance to identify key variables impacting cancellations (e.g., lead time, deposit type, room type).
  Used statistical methods and domain knowledge to select relevant features for deeper analysis.
<li>4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>

  Generated insights, such as:
  Cancellation rates by customer type, season, or booking channel.
  Impact of lead time and pricing on cancellation likelihood.
  Trends in cancellations across geographic regions or hotel types.
  Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
  Bar charts for cancellation rates by category.
  Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
  Line plots for temporal trends.

<li>5. Data Visualization</li>
  Produced clear, compelling visualizations to highlight key findings.
  Examples include:
  Distribution of cancellations by month.
  Comparison of cancellation rates across booking conditions.

<li>6. Power BI Dashboard</li>
  Exported the cleaned and processed dataset from Jupyter Notebook.
  Imported data into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard.

<h2>Dashboard features:</h2>

Summary metrics: Total bookings, cancellation rate, average lead time.
Filters: By customer type, hotel type, or date range.
Visuals: Pie charts, bar graphs, and KPI cards for a holistic view.
Goal: Provide a user-friendly interface to explore the dataset and derive business insights.

<h2>Key Insights</h2>

 Bookings with longer lead times (>90 days) have a 40% higher cancellation rate.
 Non-refunded deposits reduce cancellations by 25% compared to no-deposit bookings.
 Seasonal peaks (e.g., summer months) show elevated cancellation rates, suggesting a need for flexible policies.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
